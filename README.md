# Student-ID-Generator
used java swing as GUI for just a basic creation of id card .  it is a basic college project. 

## Upload Info or Data

<p>Some time the upload takes some problem in some devices so we have to upload it 2 times so that<br> the image is uploaded. It may vary form device to device.</p>

## Final Student ID card

## Future Works
<p><ul>
  <li> Can add a data base and link with it </li>
  <li>Verify if the Name is already in the data Base</li>
  <li>Can verify the image uploaded eg:if a student uploads pm pic then it should not take it </li>
  <li>Better User Interface </li>
</ul></p>
